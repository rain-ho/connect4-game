## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/connect4.png)

Connect 4 is a fun and challenging game that was created for an object-oriented class, showcasing the implementation of linked lists, files, and classes. Some parts of the code were adapted from Connect4 Game Solver, originally developed by Pascal Pons <contact@gamesolver.org>, and available at <http://connect4.gamesolver.org>.

The game offers a classic and engaging experience, allowing players to drop colored discs (usually red and yellow) into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first player to connect four discs of the same color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing the opponent from doing the same.

The use of object-oriented principles in the code makes it modular and easy to maintain. Players can enjoy the game at four different difficulty levels, each offering its unique challenge. The computer AI presents strategic gameplay, providing an exciting and rewarding experience for players of all ages.

Connect 4 demonstrates the power of object-oriented programming, where linked lists, file handling, and classes come together to create an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience.


## Getting Started

To enjoy this game, simply download the .exe file and run it. Please note that the game will generate text files to store game information, so it's advisable to place the .exe file in its own folder for organization

2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

3. Make your changes and compile by using 
```sh
make
```

## Usage

Here are the main instructions:
